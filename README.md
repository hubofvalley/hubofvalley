  <h1>Welcome to Hub of Valley</h1>
</div>

Hub of Valley is your one-stop resource for everything related to Grand Valley’s validator ecosystem. I provide robust validator services across multiple networks, and I'm proud to be the genesis validator on Namada and Story Protocol – with many more collaborations on the horizon!

## About Me

I’m Baconvalley (Grand Valley #1), a dedicated validator committed to the technical and community aspects of running a secure network. Beyond simply managing nodes, I actively engage with the community because I believe a validator’s true strength lies in both maintaining the network’s integrity and fostering a vibrant, informed community of developers and users.

## What I Do

- **Node Operation & Management:** I ensure every block is validated with precision, keeping our networks secure and resilient.
- **Community Engagement:** I'm always available to share insights, provide support, and empower developers to deploy and manage their own nodes.
- **Innovative Tools:** Grand Valley is not just about running nodes—I’ve built tools like *Valley of Story (VoS)*, *Valley of Namada (VoN)*, *Valley of 0G (Vo0G)*, and more. These bash-script utilities help users interact with their nodes through a simple CLI, making node operations accessible even for beginners.
- **Public Infrastructure Services:** In addition to validator operations, I offer RPC services and other public endpoint tools (my EVM-RPCs have been listed on [chainlist](http://chainlist.org/)). Explore my [Testnet Guides](https://github.com/hubofvalley/Testnet-Guides/tree/main) and [Mainnet Guides](https://github.com/hubofvalley/Mainnet-Guides/tree/main) to learn more about the comprehensive services I provide.

## My Mission

I lead by example—delivering not only a reliable validator service but also building a community where developers and users can collaborate, innovate, and shape the future of decentralized networks. Every block validated is a step forward in our journey toward a more open and decentralized digital landscape.

If you’re a developer looking for a partner who understands both the technical and community-driven sides of blockchain, let’s buidl together! I’m ready to take on new challenges as your genesis validator.
